                            <p>Backlink is one of the major ranking factors used by Google to determine the position of web pages on a search result.<br />
                            The quality of a backlink is defined by these three important metrics:
                            </p>
                            <h2 class="title d-flex align-items-center"><small><span class="fa fa-circle fa-xs mr-1"></span></small>Domain Rating</h2>
                            <p>is a score(on a 100 point scale)developed by <a href="www.ahrefs.com">Ahrefs</a> that predicts
                                how well a website will rank on search engine.the higher the domain authority the more potential
                                it has to rank high.
        
        
                            </p>
        
                            <h2 class="title d-flex align-items-center"><small><span class="fa fa-circle fa-xs mr-1"></span></small>Trust flow</h2>
                            <p>is a metric developed by Majestic SEO on a 100 point scale which predicts how trustworthy a page
                                is based on how many trustworthy sites are linking to them.
        
                            </p>
                            <h2 class="title d-flex align-items-center"><small><span class="fa fa-circle fa-xs mr-1"></span></small>Page authority</h2>
        
                            <p> is a metric developed by MOZ that predicts how well a webpage will rank on Google.
                                It is a score between 0-100, the higher the Page authority the more likely it will appear on top
                                result.
                                Page authority measures the strength of individual pages on a website.
        
                            </p>
                            <p>A quality backlink is, therefore, a website with high domain authority, high page authority for
                                the individual pages and is relevant to your niche.
                            </p>
        
                            <h2 class="title d-flex align-items-center"><small><span class="fa fa-circle fa-xs mr-1"></span></small>Relevance</h2>
                            <p>Not all websites with good SEO metrics will be beneficial for your link building campaign.
                                Building a backlink from relevant sites entails building links from websites that are in the
                                same niche, to check for the relevancy of the site you should have a quick look at the website,
                                analyze the product and services they offer, how it will benefit your business.
                                If your website sells computers, phones and gadgets, getting a site that sells apartments will
                                not help you. Make sure the site you are analyzing is covering the same topic as yours and is in
                                the same niche.
        
                            </p>
        
                            <h2 class="title d-flex align-items-center"><small><span class="fa fa-circle fa-xs mr-1"></span></small>Traffic</h2>
                            <p>It is super important to track some traffic insights about the website you are analyzing to
                                provide you a link, you should know how many unique visitors on the website per month, the
                                bounce rate on the site and the conversion rate too.
                                You can accomplish this using the google analytics tool to determine the traffic on a webpage,
                                the traffic on that page will determine how likely your site will attract new visitors.<br />                            
                                The different types of backlink mentioned above have different SEO values but the keypoint here
                                is “for you to ensure higher ranking you must build backlink. It is important to create a
                                valuable content fully optimized site so you can have the potential of ranking for any type of
                                backlink you want to use for your link building campaign.
                            </p>
                            <h2 class="title d-flex align-items-center"><small><span class="fa fa-circle fa-xs mr-1"></span></small>Indexing</h2>
                            <p>It is crucial to do all the necessary checks before acquiring backlink, think of indexing this
                                way, if the website that is linking to my site is not indexed by google how will google crawl
                                the page and find my link to be indexed. To check if the site is indexed do a search using
                                site.domainname.com.
        
                                If the search does not list the pages on that site it means it is not indexed by Google and a
                                link from a site that is not recognized will cause you not to be recognized too.
                            </p>
                            <h2 class="title d-flex align-items-center"><small><span class="fa fa-circle fa-xs mr-1"></span></small>Not penalised</h2>
                            <p>Check if the website has violated search engine best practices and is penalized. If a website is
                                penalized it will not be seen in Google when you are doing an organic search for the domain.
                            </p>
                            <h2 class="title d-flex align-items-center"><small><span class="fa fa-circle fa-xs mr-1"></span></small>Rel Attribute</h2>
                            <p>The purpose of building backlink is to increase ranking, you must check the website if it is
                                using a rel =”nofollow” tag or a do follow tag to be sure it will pass link juice to your site.
        
                            </p>
                            <h2 class="title d-flex align-items-center"><small><span class="fa fa-circle fa-xs mr-1"></span></small>Activeness</h2>
                            <p>A website that is providing you a link to your webpage should be an active site that updates
                                content regularly, not a dormant site that no activity is going on. Study the website closely to
                                know how often they post new content, check for the latest, archived and recent post dates of
                                the blog post, you should also look at the context of the post to avoid spammy link to your
                                webpage.
        
        
                            </p>
                            <h2 class="title d-flex align-items-center"><small><span class="fa fa-circle fa-xs mr-1"></span></small>Check TLD</h2>
                            <p> IS the top level domain of your website, it is the name following the dot in your URL
        
        
        
                                .com is the generic top-level domain and most website uses .com, some have some extensions added
                                to the countries
                                Example .us, .ua, .uk,
                                Try to get links from a website that has the same TLD as yours, if your website is .uk and you
                                are getting a link from.ua that will not really help your local SEO.
        
        
                            </p>
                            <h2 class="title d-flex align-items-lg-center align-items-sm-start">
                                <small><span class="fa fa-circle fa-xs align-self-sm-center mr-1"></span></small>Access the linking domain
                            </h2>
                            <p>
                                Most websites have a link from an external source too before you get links from a website you
                                should also access the types of websites that are linking to them to ensure that the linking
                                domain also has good quality and reputable sites linking to them
                            </p>
                            <p>For a successful link building campaign to ensure higher ranking, the features and qualities you
                                look for in an external website that will provide you backlinks should also be achievable in
                                your website so that others can benefit from you. Quality backlink is vice versa.
