                    <p>Backlinks exist in a wide variety of types and quality, getting familiar with the different types
                        of backlink will be helpful for the success of a website for search engines, the type of
                        backlink you acquire to your site can either impact your site positively or negatively.
                        Let us look at the different types of backlink and their impact on SEO
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="title d-flex align-items-center"><small><span class="fa fa-circle fa-xs mr-1"></span></small>Editorial links</h2>
                    <p>Editorial links are hyperlinks from very popular and high-quality websites like <a href="www.forbes.com">Forbes</a> , New York
                        times, CNN etc to your website.
                        These types of links are the most valuable for SEO as they occur naturally within the content of
                        the webpage. <br />
                        For one to earn this type of link it must really be true that you have high quality and relevant
                        content which is worth mentioning on those popular sites and being mentioned on those sites will
                        relatively increase your traffic.
                        One editorial link from relevant sites is better than 10 links from irrelevant sites.
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="title d-flex align-items-lg-center align-items-sm-start">
                        <small><span class="fa fa-circle fa-xs align-self-sm-center mr-1"></span></small>
                        Manual outreach link
                    </h2>
                    <p>These are backlinks earned from websites that do not have a high DA as the editorial links, they
                        are earned through nurturing relationships with the webmaster or who has a website which is in
                        the same niche as yours where you can offer to provide some services to them which will make
                        them link to you.
                        This type of link is very good for SEO and drives medium traffic to your website.
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="title d-flex align-items-center"><small><span class="fa fa-circle fa-xs mr-1"></span></small>Web 2.0 links</h2>
                    
                    <p>These are sites which allows user-generated content to be created on their subdomain for free
                        some examples of web2.0 links are wordpress.com,blogger.com,youtube etc.these types of links are
                        very effective for SEO.
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="title d-flex align-items-center"><small><span class="fa fa-circle fa-xs mr-1"></span></small>PBN link</h2>
                    <p>Private Blog Network, these are links on websites that you create and manage the content. PBN
                        links are essential for SEO if used in the right way but could attract a penalty if Google
                        realizes that you are linking to PBN sites.
                        Getting links from a private network is easy and is very powerful when trying to rank affiliate
                        sites. A private blog network with a high DA optimized content will be very helpful in your link
                        building campaign as it will save time from going round to ask new websites to link to you.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="title d-flex align-items-center"><small><span class="fa fa-circle fa-xs mr-1"></span></small>Linkless backlink</h2>
                    <p>Linkless backlinks are mentions of your business, product or service without any hyperlink to
                        your webpage, Google considers linkless backlink as a positive ranking signal because it cannot
                        easily be manipulated if a company or a person does not trust your brand it cannot mention you
                        in his post.
                        This linkess mention improves your brand popularity, it makes more impact on SEO if the domain
                        that mentioned your brand is authoritative and trustworthy.the more people are mentioning your
                        brand the more likely it will get a valuable boost.<br />
                        The different types of backlink mentioned above have different SEO values but the keypoint here
                        is â€œfor you to ensure higher ranking you must build backlink. It is important to create a
                        valuable content fully optimized site so you can have the potential of ranking for any type of
                        backlink you want to use for your link building campaign.
