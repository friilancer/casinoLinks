                    <p>
                        Everyone who owns a smartphone or laptop can write content. You could still get away with using
                        a
                        pen and paper if you wanted (although sending your work in might be a little bit slower). The
                        point
                        is, everyone has the tools necessary to write, yet only a small percentage of us possess the
                        skills to
                        craft our words with purpose. When businesses are in cost-cutting mode, they neglect the
                        importance of things like copywriting, as they assume anyone can put words together.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you want your content to be just as effective for the people who read it as it is for the
                        crawlers and
                        search engine bots that look at links and keywords, you need to be willing to invest in the
                        services of
                        experienced copywriters like us.
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="title d-flex align-items-lg-center align-items-sm-start">
                            <small><span class="fa fa-circle fa-xs align-self-sm-center mr-1"></span></small>Keyword friendly
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        Simply slapping a few keywords in the midst of your articles might work, to some extent, but you
                        will
                        be shooting yourself in the foot. Your human readers will feel the awkwardness when they read a
                        passage that has had a keyword awkwardly stuffed in. You want a writer who can slot those
                        keywords in without anyone noticing, making them read as naturally as possible.
                    </p>
                    <p>Remember, your SEO isn’t going to be effective if, in the process of achieving its means, it
                        alienates
                        your audience. When you are operating content for SEO, you should always remain mindful of how
                        readers will react. They want good content and they want it to read as if it was written by a
                        professional.</p>
                    <h2 class="title d-flex align-items-center"><small><span class="fa fa-circle fa-xs mr-1"></span></small>Trimming the fat</h2>
                    <p>
                        Give a bad copywriter a word count and they will find a way to hit it with their introduction
                        alone! If
                        you want high-quality copy that is worth reading, you want a copywriter who will trim away all
                        the
                        excess and the repetitions, and who will focus on filling the page with worthwhile content.

                    <h2 class="title d-flex align-items-lg-center align-items-sm-start">
                                <small><span class="fa fa-circle fa-xs align-self-sm-center mr-1"></span></small>Tricks of the trade</h2>
                    <p>
                        There is no substitute for experience. Even a very talented writer will struggle to produce good
                        copy
                        at first. It takes time to learn how to work the keywords in, how to break up your work, and
                        what
                        kind of language to use. All of this comes with experience. The words of a copywriter who has
                        worked for years are always going to be worth more than the words of a less experienced writer.
                    </p>
